merge_iweb_sites

Script to merge a classroom set of published iWeb '09 sites into one site.

Steps:

1. Start with a collection of iWeb '09 .sites2 "domain" files made by
 students. Rename each student's Domain.sites2 file so that it
 is uniquely named. 
 
2. Create a folder somewhere on your computer (I recommend within the "Sites"
 folder of your home directory) to hold the published individual websites 
 that will be merged. We will call this the "published" folder.

3. Start iWeb '09 by holding down the Option key, choose "Create a new
 domain", and specify a place to save the .sites2 domain file. 
 Choose a theme, and set the publishing settings to "Local Folder".
 Name the site with the teacher's name, and put the teacher's email 
 address in the contact box. Rename the single page in the site 
 "Home" and make a nice welcome page. Create a subfolder within the 
 "published" folder with the teacher's name, like "jsterling", and 
 publish the entire site to this folder. When publishing, set the site's 
 root URL to something like this:
 
http://kentweb.kentfieldschools.org/teacherweb/jsterling/missions2011
 
4. Close the project, rename the Domain.sites2 file with the teacher's name,
 like "jsterling.sites2" and keep it for future edits with the students' 
 .sites2 files.

5. Open each individual student's .sites2 file by double-clicking.  Make
 sure that the names of the pages within all of the .sites2 projects
 are distinct--for a website on the missions, for example, name each
 page with the name of the mission. Then publish each entire site into a 
 new subfolder of the "published" folder named after the student.

Your "published" folder should look something like this:

Your Home Folder
  Sites
    missions2011 <- This is the "published" folder
      jsterling <- This is the folder to publish teacher site to
        index.html
        jsterling
          feed.xml
          Home_files <- These "pages" must have unique names
          Home.html  <- These "pages" must have unique names
          index.html
          Media
          Scripts
      calvin <- This is the folder to publish a student site to
        index.html
        calvin <- This is the site name in iWeb
          feed.xml
          San_Francisco_Solano_files <- These "pages" must have unique names
          San_Francisco_Solano.html  <- These "pages" must have unique names
          index.html
          Media
          Scripts
      andrew <- This is the folder to publish another student site to
        index.html
        andrew <- This is the site name in iWeb
          feed.xml
          La_Purisima_Concepcion_files <- These "pages" must have unique names
          La_Purisima_Concepcion.html  <- These "pages" must have unique names
          index.html
          Media
          Scripts
     etc...   
  
4. When all the the subsites have been published, run the ruby script in
a terminal window:

$ ./merge_iweb_sites published_folder merged_folder

The merged folder should contain all the pages in one site, with a dynamic
navbar that links to all the pages.  The "Home" page will be the first
page in the navbar.

Notes:

1. All the sites must be created using the same version of iWeb.

2. Copy the "Media" and "Scripts" folders from a published iWeb project into 
the "resources" folder of this project before running the script!
